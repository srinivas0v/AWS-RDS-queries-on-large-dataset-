code.py
running on AWS, should (utilizing a web interface, from AWS) 
    - create a web page
    - import the dataset into SQL on AWS, show total number of entries on web page
    - create a simple web page to allow a user to select a state and count number of entries and show those names 
      on a web page.
    - allow a user on web page, to enter a latitude, and longitude, show all universities within 2 degrees 
      of that location.
    - allow a user to enter a city name OR a state name (user may select EITHER ONE of these), and a minimum total enrollement, 
      show the alias names (for matching), if it exists (all matching with at least that many  students, in that state or city,
      just show alias names - unless "NOT AVAILABLE")
